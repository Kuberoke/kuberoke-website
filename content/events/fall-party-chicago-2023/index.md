We will have an open bar and snacks, thanks to our generous sponsors!

**Registration**  
We will be requiring folks to register, and will have the registration form up soon!

Beginning at 8pm and whenever new slots become available, we will send out QR codes to the top addresses on the guest list, which will let you enter the venue.
Once you have received your QR code, you have a limited amount of time to arrive. If you’re late and the venue is full, you can queue at the door or come back at a later time. We will fill the venue from the queue first, before sending out new QR codes.
If the venue is not full, and you have a valid QR code, you can enter even if you’re late.

**Safety & Accessibility**  
By attending the event, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/coc). Please make sure you have reviewed it prior to the event.

In accordance with local laws and regulations, we do *not* require mask wearing or proof of vaccination. Masks & hand sanitizer will be made available at the venue for those who want it.
Please be aware that the venue is small and there will be loud singing. If you are concerned about infection risk, we would advise you to not attend.

The venue is ADA compliant. It should be accessible for most mobility aids.
